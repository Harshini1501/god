        <h3>Indian philosophy has a rich tradition of discussing the existence of God. The concept of God is central to many Indian religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. While some schools of thought, such as Sankhya, do not explicitly establish the existence of God, they do not deny it either. Instead, they argue that Prakrti and Purusas are sufficient to explain the universe and therefore there is no reason for postulating a hypothesis of God1.

            Other schools of thought, such as Nyaya, have developed purely rational and logical approaches to the question of the existence and nature of God2. Udayana, a philosopher of Nyaya, defined eight arguments for the existence of God, including the active cause, the originator of the bringing together of the atoms, the conserver and destroyer of the world, and the numerical structure of the universe3.
            
            It is important to note that the nature of the deities Indians believe in varies. While the majority of Hindus and Jains say there is “only one God with many manifestations,” most Muslims, Christians, and Sikhs say there is “only one God” </h3>
